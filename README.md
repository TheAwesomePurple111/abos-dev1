# Advanced Batch OS Developer Release 1
This is the Developer Release 1 of a project I've been working on: Advanced Batch OS.
For now, this build includes very little content, so...

# FAQ
Q: Can I make suggestions?
A: Yes.

Q: Help! There's a bug in the OS!
A: Make an issue, and I'll try to fix your bug.

Q: Can I fork your repo?
A: Definitely yes. In fact, forking the repo isn't just allowed, it's encouraged. If your forked version has good enough features, then I'll integrate those features from your repo!

Q: How do I install this?
A: Right now, there isn't an installer for this, only a pre-copy batch file. Refer to READ1ST.txt in the .zip file (right now in the SOURCE folder) on where to put the files.

Q: Which OS do I need?
A: Windows (so far only tested on Windows 11 22H2).

Q: How do I run this on other OSes?
A: Use a virtualizer (applies to Mac OS and every Linux distro). VirtualBox is highly recommended. If you're on iOS or Android, you're probably out of luck.
